# Nancy.Metadata.OpenApi

This repository is a hard fork of the https://github.com/HackandCraft/Nancy.Metadata.Swagger repository, since it seems inactive. 

---
Currently a work-in progress to migrate to OpenApi Version 3.0.0. implementation for usage with NancyFx. This Repo depends on the following libraries:

* [NancyFx](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy)
* [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
* [NJsonSchema](https://github.com/NJsonSchema/NJsonSchema)

The OpenApi specification can be found here: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/versions/3.0.md
